**Soil texture** refers to the relative proportions of different sizes of soil particles and is determined by the percentage of sand, silt, and clay present in the soil. These proportions influence nearly every aspect of soil use and management, such as water retention, nutrient availability, and aeration¹.

Here's a breakdown of the particle sizes:
- **Sand**: 2.0 – 0.05 mm in diameter
- **Silt**: 0.05 – 0.002 mm
- **Clay**: Less than 0.002 mm

The combination of these sizes determines the soil's textural class, which can affect its suitability for various crops and its response to environmental conditions like drought or lime requirements². Soil texture is typically classified using a soil texture triangle, which helps to identify the textural class based on the percentages of sand, silt, and clay.
