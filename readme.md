# Cropify âœ¨
Cropify is an AI-powered agriculture solution that analyzes farm data including `crop types, soil fertility, weather conditions`, and more to provide personalized recommendations for disease and pest control, irrigation practices, fertilizer application, crop growth monitoring, and productivity enhancement. Additionally, farmers can upload `images of diseased crops or pests` to receive information on the identified disease or pest, including causes and recommendations for control. The system also allows farmers to engage in a `chat with the AI` for additional advice and information to enhance their farming practices.
